; NAME:
;   cgLogScl
;
; PURPOSE:
;   This is a utility routine to perform a logarithmic transformation
;   on an image. The shape of the transformation is similar to the gamma
;   curve (see cgGmaScl), except that the shape of the gamma curve is 
;   variable, while the log curve is fixed. The function is used to improve 
;   contrast in images.

;+
; This is a utility routine to perform a logarithmic transformation
; on an image. The shape of the transformation is similar to the gamma
; curve (see cgGmaScl), except that the shape of the gamma curve is 
; variable, while the log curve is fixed. The function is used to improve 
; contrast in images. The equation being implemented before scaling between 
; OMIN and OMAX is as follows::
; 
;     output = constant * Log(1 + double(input))
;
; :Categories:
;    Image Processing
;
; :Returns:
;     A byte scaled image is returned.
;
; :Params:
;    image: in, required
;       The image to be scaled. Written for 2D images, but arrays of any size are treated alike.
;
; :Keywords:
;     constant: in, optional, type=float, default=1.0
;         A contant value by which the log result is multiplied.
;
;     max: in, optional
;          Any value in the input image greater than this value is set to this value
;          before scaling.
;          
;     min: in, optional
;          Any value in the input image less than this value is set to this value
;          before scaling.
;
;     negative, in, optional, type=boolean, default=0
;          If set, the "negative" of the result is returned.
;
;     omax: in, optional, type=byte, default=255
;          The output image is scaled between OMIN and OMAX.
;
;     omin: in, optional, type=byte, default=0
;          The output image is scaled between OMIN and OMAX.
;
; :Examples:
;    Examples of compression stretching::
;       cgLoadCT, 0                                         ; Gray-scale colors.
;       image = cgDemoData(22)                              ; Load image.
;       cgImage, image                                      ; No contrast.
;       cgImage, cgLogScl(image)                            ; Improved contrast.
