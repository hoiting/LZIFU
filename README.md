# LZIFU
* LZIFU (“LaZy-IFU”) is an emission line fitting pipeline for [integral field spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_field_spectrograph) (IFS) data. The pipeline was developed as part of my thesis work and is designed to turn IFS data to 2D emission line flux and kinematic maps for further analysis. LZIFU has been applied and tested extensively to various IFS data, including the [SAMI Galaxy Survey](sami-survey.org), the [Wide-Field Spectrograph (WiFeS)](http://rsaa.anu.edu.au/observatories/instruments/wide-field-spectrograph-wifes), the [CALIFA survey](www.caha.es/CALIFA/public_html/), the [S7 survey](https://miocene.anu.edu.au/S7/), etc. It has also been applied to the new MUSE instrument on the VLT. For details about the software, please refer to the corresponding paper (Ho et al. 2016, Ap&SS, ?, ?)

* For the version 1.0 release of LZIFU, please go to the [release page](https://github.com/hoiting/LZIFU/releases). 

* README.pdf contains instruction for installing and running LZIFU

* Note that although LZIFU has already been used and tested by several astronomers, there could still be bugs in the code. This program is freely available, but it comes without any warranty. If you encounter any problems with the code, I would appreciate you reporting them to I-Ting Ho itho@ifa.hawaii.edu. I will try my best to debug and reply your email in a timely manner.
